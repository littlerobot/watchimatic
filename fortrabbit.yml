# to assure backward compatibility on format changes, specify the version

# default strategy is "nodelete"
strategy: fullsync

# Excludes work only with the "fullsync" strategy. You can either use YAML array
#   notification or an rsync formatted exclusion file. All excludes are below the
#   htdocs/ folder

# array notification:
excludes:
#    - uploads/
#    - media/images/
#    - media/videos/

# rsync exclude file:
#   you can use a .gitignore file, however the rsync format is not 100% compatible
#   with the .gitignore pattern and there is a risk (use caution!)
#excludes: my-excludes

# composer settings
composer:
    # mode can be "trigger" (default) or "always"
    mode: always

    # method can be "update" (default) or "install"
    method: install

    # normally dev requirements are ignored (--no-dev), you can enable them:
    #include-dev: 1
